# Pilot.js
Pilot is a script that allows any font width, to respond to the window size. For this, it needs two fonts to make de stretch possible, since each master indicates de minimum and maximum width the font can take. </p>

This script uses the jQuery and [opentype.js](http://opentype.js.org/), witch allows to read a font data and change it.
